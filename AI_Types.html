    <br>
    Artificial Intelligence can be divided into various types, there are mainly two types of the main categorization which are:
    
    <p> <b>A. Based on Capabilities </b></p>

    <p> 
    <b>1. Weak AI or Narrow AI <br> </b>
     Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence. The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence. <b> Apple Siri</b> is a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions. Some  Examples of Narrow AI are Google translate, playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce sites, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.
     <br> <br>
    <b> 2. General AI <br></b> 
    General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.The idea behind the general AI to make such a system that could be smarter and think like a human on its own. Currently, there is no such system exists which could come under general AI and can perform any task as perfect as a human.
    <br> <br>
    <b> 3. Super AI <br></b>
     Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than a human with cognitive properties. This refers to aspects like general wisdom, problem solving and creativity. It is an outcome of general AI.

        <ol>
            <li> <b>Reactive Machines </b>
        <ul>
            <li> Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
            <li> Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.</li>
            <li> These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.</li>
            <li> IBM's Deep Blue system is an example of reactive machines.</li>
            <li> Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines. </li><br>
        </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <b>Limited Memory </b>
                <ul>
                    <li> Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.</li>
                    <li> These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.</li>
                    <li> Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed limits, and other information to navigate the road.</li>
                    
                </ul><br>
                    </li>
            <li> <b>Theory of Mind </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.</li>
                            <li> This type of AI machines is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.</li> 
                        </ul><br>
                            </li>
         <li> <b>Self-Awareness </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.</li>
                            <li> These machines will be smarter than the human mind.</li>
                            <li> Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.</li>
                        </ul><br>
