<h2>What IoT means?</h2>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:rgb(7, 7, 7)"> 
<p> 
    The <b> Internet of Things (IoT)</b>  is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human intervention.
</p>
The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active engagement, and small device use.
<ol>
<li> <b> AI </b>− IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks.</li>
<li> <b> Connectivity </b>− New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system devices.</li>
<li> <b> Sensors </b> − IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world integration.</li>
<li> <b> Active Engagement</b>−  Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.</li>
<li> <b> Small Devices</b> − Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.</li>
</ol>

<p> Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.

By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.
