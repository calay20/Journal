                  <h5><br>
       AI is only as good as the data it is exposed to, which is where certain challenges may present
    themselves. How a business teaches and develops its AI will be the major factor in its usefulness.
    Humans could be the weak link here, as people are unlikely to want to input masses of data into a
    system.
    <p> Another dilemma that comes along with AI is its potential to replace human workers. As machines
    become more “intelligent” they could begin to replace experts in higher-level jobs. Alternatively,
    AI also has the potential to take the burden of laborious and time-consuming tasks from these
    people, freeing up their time and brainpower for other things e.g. doctors using diagnostic AI to
    help them diagnose patients will analyze the data presented by the AI and make the ultimate
    decision. Managing the challenges posed by AI will require careful planning to ensure that the full
    benefits are realized and risks are mitigated.</p>

                  <h5><br>
                    With automation and robotics moving from production lines out into other areas of work and
                business, the potential for humans losing jobs is great here too. As automation technologies
    become more advanced, there will be a greater capability for automation to take over more and
    more complex jobs. As robots learn to teach each other and themselves, there is the potential for
    much greater productivity but this also raises ethical and cybersecurity concerns.

        <h5><br>
            As more and more connected devices (such as smartwatches and fitness trackers) join the Internet
            of Things (IoT) the amount of data being generated is increasing. Companies will have to plan
            carefully how this will affect the customer-facing application and how to best utilize the masses
            of data being produced. There are also severe security implications of mass connectivity that need
            to be addressed.

          <h3 class="card-title"><u>  Challenges in Big Data </u></h3>
          <h5><br>
            Almost all the technologies mentioned above have some relation to Big Data. The huge amount of
            data being generated on a daily basis has the potential to provide businesses with better insight
            into their customers as well as their own business operations.
            <p> 
            Although data can be incredibly useful for spotting trends and analyzing impacts, surfacing all this
            data to humans in a way that they can understand can be challenging. AI will play a role here.</p>

                New and emerging technologies pose significant opportunities for businesses if they utilize them
                well and understand their true value early on. They also pose risks and questions not only to
                business but to society as a whole. Planning for how to deal with these emerging technologies and
                where value can be derived while assessing potential risks before they become a fully-fledged
                reality is essential for businesses that want to thrive in the world of AI, Big Data and IoT.

                <p><b> Some risks of emerging technology are:
                </b>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>  <b> Driverless car:</b> while a compelling option for future fleer cars, companies could crash and
                            burn from claims related to bodily injury and property damage.</li><br> 
                        <li>  <b> Wearables:</b>  Google glass, Fitbit and other wearables can expose companies to the invasion
                                of privacy claims that may not be covered by general liability or personal injury claims that
                                weren’t foreseen.</li><br> 
                        <li>  <b> Drones:</b>   Turbulence is in the offing for manufacturers and organizations that fail to protect
                            themselves for property damage and bodily injury, as well as errors and omissions.</li><br> 
                        <li>  <b> Internet of things:</b>  The proliferation of sensors and cross-platform integration creates
                            potential exposure from privacy invasion, bodily injury and property damage that may
                            connect an organization to huge liabilities..</li><br>
