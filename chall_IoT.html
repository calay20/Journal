        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td><b>Security  </b>− IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to various kinds of attackers.</td>
        <td>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</td>
        <td><b> Improved Customer Engagement </b>− Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td><b> Privacy </b>− The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without the user's active participation.</td>
        <td>If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</td>
        <td> <b> Technology Optimization </b> − The same technologies and data which improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td><b> Complexity </b>− Some find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling technologies.</td>
        <td>Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</td>
        <td> <b>Reduced Waste </b> − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td><b>Flexibility  </b>− Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily with another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locking systems.</td>
        <td>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</td>
        <td><b>Enhanced Data Collection  </b>− Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.</td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
        <td><b>Compliance  </b>− IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply with regulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many consider standard software compliance a battle.</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
